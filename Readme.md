# CRQS for Flow Framework

This package is currently under development and not fully working, please don't use it in production.

This package is inspired by [LiteCQRS](https://github.com/beberlei/litecqrs-php) and [Broadway](https://github.com/qandidate-labs/broadway).

The goal of the project is to offer a lean and opinionated way to integrate CQRS pattern in your Flow framework package.
